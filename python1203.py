#3.Comparison Operator
a = 10
b = 12
c = 5
d = 2

#3.1 Output=>: a > b is Fasle
print('a > b is',a > b)

#3.2 Output=>: a < b is True
print('a < b is',a < b)

#3.3 Output=>: a == b is False
print('a == b is',a == b)

#3.4 Output=>: a != b is  True
print('a != b is',a != b)

#3.5 Output=>: a >= b is  False
print('a >= b is',a >= b)

#3.6 Output=>: a <= b is  True
print('a <= b is',a <= b)

#3.7 equal to opearor
print('c == d is',c == d)

#3.8 not equal to opearor
print('c != d is',c != d)

#3.9 greater than operator
print('c > d is',c > d)

#3.10 less than operator
print('c < d is',c < d)

#3.11 greater than or equal to operator
print('c >= d is',c >= d)
